Hello, this is Strawberries777.
Before using this model, please read this.
(TL;DR: STUFF IN FOLDER. I EDIT SOMETIME. YOU ME ASK QUESTION. GIVE ME CREDIT!)

In the folder, you'll find the original photoshop files of the textures. The .blend files were originally made in Blender 2.65.1, so if you're using a different version and are experiencing some strange glitches, that may be why. I'll also export the models to an .obj format just in case you don't use Blender.

I wasn't planning on putting this up for download so early, so I'll probably make a few changes every once in a while. (Like pretty-fying the rig with shapes for easier use.)

If you have a quick question or two, let me know at either strawberries777.deviantart.com or strawberries777.tumblr.com and I'll try my best to answer them. Just so you know, though, I will not teach you how to use Blender if you don't know how. (I barely know how to use it myself. ;_;)

Most importantly, please give credit where credit is due! I worked really hard on this and would appreciate it so much. Of course, you don't have to scream my name in everyone's face constantly, but at least inform them that I made the base in case they do ask or are implying that they think you made it...
